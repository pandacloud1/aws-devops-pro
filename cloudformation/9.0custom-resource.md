## Custom Resource
It is used to
- Create resources not supported by CloudFormation
- Define custom logic for resources outside CloudFormation
- Have custom scripts run through Lambda (eg. Run Lambda to empty S3 bucket)

```yaml
Resource:
  MyCustomResource:
    Type: Custom::MyResource
    Properties:
      ServiceToken: <lambda- or sns-arn>
      Property: "Value"
```
