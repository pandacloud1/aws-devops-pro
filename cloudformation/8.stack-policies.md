## Stack Policies
- How do I protect resources from getting updated?
In this case, we can make use of CloudFormation Stack Policies
These are JSON policies, where you can define which resources must be prevented from update

```json
{
  Statement [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Affect": "Update",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Resource": "*"
   },
   Statement
     {
       "Effect": "Deny",
       "Action": "Update:*",
       "Principal": "*",
       "Resource": "LogicalResourceId/Production"
    }
  ]
}
```
- Note: This will allow update on all resources, except with resource ID 'Production'
