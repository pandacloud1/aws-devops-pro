## Stack Policies
- How do I protect resources from getting updated?
<br>In this case, we can make use of CloudFormation Stack Policies
<br>These are JSON policies, where you can define which resources must be prevented from update

```json
{
  Statement [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Affect": "Update",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Resource": "*"
   },
   Statement
     {
       "Effect": "Deny",
       "Action": "Update:*",
       "Principal": "*",
       "Resource": "LogicalResourceId/Production"
    }
  ]
}
```
- Note: This will allow update on all resources, except with resource ID 'Production'
